**Description**: Project EFB was an unreleased group project where I handled the movement logic using a state machine design pattern. The game was based around traversal with a glide/flight mechanic, and I managed all collision logic.

**Scripts**: [OOP Work and Movement Logic](https://github.com/Kiru671/EFB_Scripts)

**Legacy Version**: [Different Gliding Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sda4-PCvpYM)

**Conclusion**: This project resulted in a flight mechanic that feels intuitive and nice to control. It honed my skills in creating state machine patterns and handling complex mechanics.

### Project 3: Hazard Hunt

**Description**: This game was developed during a game jam funded by the US Embassy to raise awareness about earthquakes. Our team won first place and received support for further development. I worked on the modular level selection system, breakable objects, audio, and helped with the earthquake simulation.

**Conclusion**: This project allowed me to work on a socially impactful game while improving my skills in modular level design and simulation mechanics.

### Project 4: Apocalypse Hauler (VR)

**Description**: This VR simulation experience was a team effort to simulate a post-apocalyptic scenario where players use a modified excavator to gather resources and help survivors. I worked on the movement mechanics, controls, and a quest system utilizing scriptable objects.

**Scripts**: [Relevant Scripts](https://github.com/Kiru671/Apocalypse_Hauler_Scripts)

**Conclusion**: This project enhanced my understanding of VR development and Object-Oriented Programming, especially with the quest system.
