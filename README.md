## üìÇ Projects

### Project 1: Highway Run

![Highway Run](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f584fe93-533d-4a31-94fa-990ac041a92b)


**Description**: This was a solo project completed in under a month using visual scripting in UE4. It's an endless runner game where the goal is to never slow down. I also created the music for the game.

### Project 2: Project EFB

![Project EFB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1746bb70-e1dc-4ff8-9736-4c6baaf3596a)


**Description**: Project EFB was an unreleased group project where I handled the movement logic using a state machine design pattern. The game was based around traversal with a glide/flight mechanic, and I managed all collision logic.

**Scripts**: [OOP Work and Movement Logic](https://github.com/Kiru671/EFB_Scripts)

**Legacy Version**: [Different Gliding Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sda4-PCvpYM)

**Conclusion**: This project resulted in a flight mechanic that feels intuitive, with a movement economy that engages the player. It honed my skills in creating state machine patterns and handling complex mechanics.

### Project 3: Apocalypse Hauler (VR)

**Scripts**: [Relevant Scripts](https://github.com/Kiru671/Apocalypse_Hauler_Scripts)

**Conclusion**: This project enhanced my understanding of VR development and Object-Oriented Programming, especially with the quest system.

### Project 4: Hazard Hunt

![Hazard Hunt](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200)  <!-- Replace with your image -->

**Description**: This game was developed during a game jam funded by the US Embassy to raise awareness about earthquakes. Our team won first place and received support for further development. I worked on the modular level selection system, breakable objects, audio, and helped with the earthquake simulation.
