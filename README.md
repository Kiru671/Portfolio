# üéÆ Game Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my game developer portfolio! Down below, you will find some of the projects I partook in and made on my own in the last 4 years.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Kerem**. I believe games are the **perfect** medium. Like a book waiting to be read, only ***much*** more immersive with visuals and interactivity. I also love their painstaking creation process. I love finding solutions to how a certain mechanic or system would be added to a game and how I could build upon such things. 
And I want to leave my mark on projects I'll be proud of ***and*** want to play.

## üìÇ School Projects

### Project 1: Highway Run

![Highway Run](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f584fe93-533d-4a31-94fa-990ac041a92b)


**Description**: This was a solo project completed in under a month using visual scripting in UE4. It's an endless runner game where the goal is to never slow down. I also created the music for the game.

**Gameplay Video**: [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7tafZ5Es0os/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tafZ5Es0os)

**Screenshots**: [Link to screenshots](#)

**Conclusion**: This project helped me understand the basics of game objects and their interactions using classes. It also improved my ability to work with Ableton for music creation.

### Project 2: Project EFB

![Project EFB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1746bb70-e1dc-4ff8-9736-4c6baaf3596a)


**Description**: Project EFB was an unreleased group project where I handled the movement logic using a state machine design pattern. The game was based around traversal with a glide/flight mechanic, and I managed all collision logic.

**Scripts**: [OOP Work and Movement Logic](https://github.com/Kiru671/EFB_Scripts)

**Legacy Version**: [Different Gliding Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sda4-PCvpYM)

**Conclusion**: This project resulted in a flight mechanic that feels intuitive and nice to control. It honed my skills in creating state machine patterns and handling complex mechanics.

### Project 3: Hazard Hunt

![Hazard Hunt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9af755d5-ed35-4286-a562-73ae394f6850)


**Description**: This game was developed during a game jam funded by the US Embassy to raise awareness about earthquakes. Our team won first place and received support for further development. I worked on the modular level selection system, breakable objects, audio, and helped with the earthquake simulation.

**Itch.io Link**: [Hazard Hunt](https://kiru176.itch.io/hazard-hunt)

**Conclusion**: This project allowed me to work on a socially impactful game while improving my skills in modular level design and simulation mechanics.

### Project 4: Apocalypse Hauler (VR)

**Description**: This VR simulation experience was a team effort to simulate a post-apocalyptic scenario where players use a modified excavator to gather resources and help survivors. I worked on the movement mechanics, controls, and a quest system utilizing scriptable objects.

**Video**: [![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/M6d6syOWEkg/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/M6d6syOWEkg)

**Scripts**: [Relevant Scripts](https://github.com/Kiru671/Apocalypse_Hauler_Scripts)

**Conclusion**: This project enhanced my understanding of VR development and Object-Oriented Programming, especially with the quest system.
