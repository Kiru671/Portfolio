## About Me 



Hi, I'm **Kerem**. I recently graduated with a major in Game Design, and I'm currently studying Computer Programming.

I believe games are the **perfect** medium‚Äî***much*** more immersive than any other, with gorgeous visuals and interactivity. I love their painstaking creation process, especially finding solutions to implement mechanics or systems and building upon them.

I aim to leave my mark on projects I'll be proud of ***and*** want to play.
